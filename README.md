# Black-Scholes-Option-Pricing-Model-Web-App
This interactive Streamlit app allows users to dynamically explore and visualise call and put option prices using the Black-Scholes formula. Users can input a stock ticker, customise option parameters, and visualise results through a heatmap with optional profit/loss colouring.

## Features

- **Live stock data input** via ticker symbol
- **Black-Scholes pricing** for call and put options
- Customizable input parameters: stock price, strike, time to maturity, volatility, risk-free rate
- **Interactive heatmap**:
  - Choose **any two parameters** to plot option price sensitivity
  - Optional red/green **profit/loss visualisation** if purchase prices are entered

---

- **Python 3**
- `streamlit` for app visualisation
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `yfinance` for downloading historical stock data
- `matplotlib and seaborn` for data visualisation
- `numpy` for numerical calculations
